89,"Into the Unknown (From ""Frozen 2""/Soundtrack Version)","Idina Menzel, AURORA","THE VOICE Ah-ah-ah-ah Ah-ah-ah-ah Ah-ah-ah-ahh--ah-ah  ELSA I can hear you But I won’t. Some look for trouble While others don’t. There’s a thousand reasons I should go about my day And ignore your whispers Which I wish would go away… Oh-oh  THE VOICE Ah-ah-ah-ah  ELSA Oh-oh  THE VOICE Ah-ah-ah-ahh--ah-ah  ELSA You’re not a voice. You’re just a ringing in my ear And if I heard you (which I don’t) I’m spoken for, I fear. Everyone I’ve ever loved is here within these walls I’m sorry, secret siren, but I’m blocking out your calls.  I’ve had my adventure I don’t need something new! I’m afraid of what I’m risking if I follow you  Into the unknown… Into the unknown… Into the unknown!  THE VOICE Ah-ah-ah-ah  ELSA"
90,Someone Like You,Adele,I heard That you're settled down That you Found a girl And you're Married now I heard That your dreams came true Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend Why are you so shy Ain't like you to hold back Or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited But I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it I'd hoped you'd see my face And that you'd be reminded That for me it isn't over Never mind I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you too Don't forget me I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love But sometimes it hurts instead Sometimes it lasts in love But sometimes it hurts instead You'd know how The time flies Only yesterday It was the time of our lives We were born and raised in a summer haze Bound by the surprise Of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited But I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded That for me it isn't over Never mind I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you too Don't forget me I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love But sometimes it hurts instead Nothing compares No worries or cares Regrets and mistakes And memories made Who would have known How bittersweet This would taste Never mind I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you Don't forget me I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love But sometimes it hurts instead Never mind I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you too Don't forget me I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love But sometimes it hurts instead Sometimes it lasts in love But sometimes it hurts instead
